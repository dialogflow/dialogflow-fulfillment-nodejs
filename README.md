# Dialogflow Fulfillment Library
The [Dialogflow Fulfillment Library](https://dialogflow.com/docs/fulfillment) allows you to connect natural language understanding and processing to your own systems, APIs, and databases. Using Fulfillment, you can surface commands and information from your services to your users through a natural conversational interface.

Dialogflow Fulfillment makes creating fulfillment for Dialogflow v1 and v2 agents for 8 chat and voice platforms on Node.js easy and simple.

This library is intended to help build Node.js Dialogflow Fulfillment for multiple [integrations](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/) including Google Assistant, Slack, Facebook, Telegram, Kik, Skype, Line, and Viber. See the reference documentation for more: https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/fulfillment-library/webhook-client

If only building Dialogflow Fulfillment for the [Google Assistant](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/google-assistant) and no other integrations, use the Actions on Google NPM module ([actions-on-google](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actions-on-google)) which supports all Actions on Google features.
